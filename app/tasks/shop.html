<!-- A mock checkout page to test impact of nagware.

This asks the user to select two items from the page and then go to the checkout.

The pretense will be an e-commerce site selling phone accessories.

This page will require slightly more work to simulate a checkout counter
(similar to Amazon) and products to be displayed in a grid view.

PLEASE NOTE - This page is only used for experimental purposes.-->
