#Quälend


The German word for nagging, Quälend is an experiment in the effectiveness of nagware in educating and warning internet users of the dangers of insecure websites.

The scope of the project explores two types of nagware:
1. Audio
2. Visual

The development of these two are in the same branch due to them both sharing the content of the website itself.

Getting Started
----
To get up and running with development, __you need the following installed__:
* npm `Different for each OS. Google it`
* bower `$ npm install -g bower`
* gruntjs `$ npm install -g grunt-cli`

On __first run__ the following needs to be run:
`$ npm install`
`$ bower install`  
`$ grunt `

When you want to __run locally__:  
`$ grunt serve`


When in Deployment
----
The website in this repo will always display the nagware. Part of the experiment is placing this website on an insecure server with CA problems. This will simulate the dangers in a contained and quarantined nature.

The test participants will be asked to carry out a number of tasks on the page as part of their work.
